Task Tracker App - Project Report

Overview of the Application
The task tracker is a simple console based application that helps users manage their priority tasks. It allows users to add tasks with a title, category, priority, and due date - Search for tasks by title - View tasks by category - Display high-priority task reminders  This app is useful for organizing daily or weekly responsibilities, ensuring users don't miss high-priority or time-sensitive items. It's especially handy for students or professionals who want a basic tool to manage their workload without using complex software.

1. Recursive Task Search Algorithm
Purpose: To search for a task by its title using recursion. How it works: It starts at index 0 of the task list and checks each title until a match is found or the end is reached.
Big O: O(n) — In the worst case, it searches through the entire list.

Data Structures Used

ArrayList, hashmaps, linkedlist

Future Improvements
- Add file input/output to save and load tasks between sessions this could allow for mass importation of tasks when transferring from one task management app to another
