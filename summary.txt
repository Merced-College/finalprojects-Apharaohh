This app is used to create tasks and to be able to manage them.
You will also be able to sort through them, list all of the tasks as well as be able to do basic things such as being able to search for a specific task.
This will include the different type of priorties such as low, mid, high.
So far what I have is the basic UI for the user to experience adding a task, showing the list of tasks, as well as exiting the program. 
This will allow you to set the category as well as the title of the task itself.
What I have left is to introduce the logic to support the prioritization of the tasks, include a stack queue to be able to undo the most recent task creation, and be able to call a recursive function to search through the tasks.
This will be the bulk of the logic to introduce the functionality of the task creation and execution of the different algorithms and data structures.
